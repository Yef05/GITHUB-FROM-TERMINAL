#   Drivers of High Speciation Rates in Angiosperms During the Andean Uplift

The Andes are estimated to host approximately 10% of the world's vascular plant diversity (around 30,000 species) within just 0.6% of the Earth's land surface (Mittermeier et al., 2004), many of which are endemic to the region (Madriñán et al., 2013). Despite this extraordinary richness, only about 25% of the original vegetation remains, making the Andes the most species-rich plant biodiversity hotspot in the world (Myers et al., 2000).

## Main Drivers

Type | Driver
-------|-----------
Abiotic | Allopatric barrier
Biotic | pollination syndromes
